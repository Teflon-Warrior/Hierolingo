        <h2>About DataGlpyh</h2>

        <p>Our team has a pursuant interest in history but especially in the subject surrounding ancient Egypt and its
            culture. While there is a lot we do know about the culture, there are still many scripts that are left
            undeciphered. We would love to be able to understand these texts to learn more about their society, but they
            are unfortunately written using hieroglyphs. After conducting research into online language learning
            services, there are no low cost options for learning to decipher hieroglyphs. So, in order to gain a better
            understanding of Ancient Egyptian society we intend on creating Dataglyph. Dataglyph will be a free to use
            website that will provide lessons to users in order to teach them the language. The overarching goal of our
            project is to increase the number of individuals that have the ability to read hieroglyphs. By increasing
            this number of individuals, not only will the language not become extinct, but the number of deciphered
            scripts will continue to increase before the old scripts are lost to time.

        <p>
            Providing the public with the ability to learn to read ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs has many benefits.
            Increasing the number of individuals that can decipher ancient Egyptian scripts can help the world
            understand more about their society.
